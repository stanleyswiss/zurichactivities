# Comprehensive Swiss Events Scraping System - Major Improvements

## Overview
Transformed the Swiss events scraping system from a limited Alpsabzug-focused scraper into a comprehensive regional events aggregation system. This addresses all the major issues identified and significantly expands event coverage.

## Problems Solved

### 1. **Fixed Inconsistent Data Display**
**Issue**: Events from different scrapers showed different formats (ST events showed distance, ALPSABZUG events didn't).

**Solution**: 
- **Unified Data Structure**: All scrapers now return consistent `lat`, `lon`, `city`, `venueName`, `street`, `postalCode` fields
- **Enhanced Geocoding**: Improved Swiss address parsing with proper postal code extraction
- **Reverse Geocoding**: Added city extraction from coordinates when addresses aren't available
- **Consistent Location Parsing**: Standardized address component extraction across all scrapers

**Files Modified**:
- `/railway-worker/src/myswitzerland-scraper.js` - Enhanced geocoding and address parsing
- `/src/lib/scrapers/switzerland-tourism.ts` - Added reverse geocoding for city extraction  
- `/src/lib/scrapers/limmattal.ts` - Improved address component parsing

### 2. **Fixed MySwitzerland Timeout Issues**
**Issue**: 30-second timeout causing failures on slow-loading pages.

**Solution**:
- **Increased Timeout**: 30s → 60s for page loading
- **Smart Wait Strategies**: Wait for specific elements instead of generic timeouts
- **Retry Logic**: 3-attempt retry system with exponential backoff
- **Better Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when pages fail to load

**Files Modified**:
- `/railway-worker/src/myswitzerland-scraper.js` - Enhanced timeout and retry logic

### 3. **Expanded MySwitzerland Beyond Alpsabzug**
**Issue**: Only scraping Alpsabzug events, missing thousands of other valuable events.

**Solution**:
- **New Comprehensive Scraper**: `/railway-worker/src/comprehensive-myswitzerland-scraper.js`
- **7 Event Categories**: Festivals, Markets, Culture, Music, Family, Sports, Alpsabzug
- **Distance-Based Filtering**: 200km radius from Schlieren instead of event type filtering
- **Category-Specific URLs**: Individual scraping for each event category
- **Improved Content Filtering**: Excludes administrative/political events

**Categories Added**:
```javascript
{
  name: 'Festivals', url: '.../?rubrik=festivals', category: 'festival'
  name: 'Markets', url: '.../?rubrik=maerkte', category: 'markt'
  name: 'Culture', url: '.../?rubrik=kultur', category: 'kultur'
  name: 'Music', url: '.../?rubrik=musik', category: 'musik'
  name: 'Family', url: '.../?rubrik=familie', category: 'familie'
  name: 'Sports', url: '.../?rubrik=sport', category: 'sport'
  name: 'Alpsabzug', url: '.../?rubrik=alpabzuegeaelplerfeste', category: 'alpsabzug'
}
```

### 4. **Added Comprehensive Municipal Scraping**
**Issue**: Only scraping Limmattal region.

**Solution**:
- **New Municipal Architecture**: `/railway-worker/src/municipal-scraper-architecture.js`
- **10 Municipalities**: Schlieren, Dietikon, Urdorf, Oberengstringen, Weiningen, Baden, Wohlen, Bremgarten, Birmensdorf, Uitikon
- **Systematic Approach**: Common patterns for Swiss municipal websites
- **Multiple URL Attempts**: Try various event page patterns per municipality
- **Smart Content Detection**: JSON-LD extraction + HTML parsing fallback

**Municipalities Added**:
- **High Priority**: Schlieren, Dietikon, Urdorf (immediate Schlieren area)
- **Medium Priority**: Oberengstringen, Weiningen, Baden, Wohlen (nearby cities)
- **Low Priority**: Bremgarten, Birmensdorf, Uitikon (extended coverage)

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling & Reliability**
**Solution**:
- **Retry Logic**: 2-3 attempts with exponential backoff across all scrapers
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with other scrapers if one fails
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Skip consistently failing sources
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error tracking and debugging info
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful delays between requests (1-2 seconds)

### 6. **Improved Performance & Architecture**
**Solution**:
- **Railway Workers**: Long-running scrapers moved to Railway for unlimited execution time
- **Vercel Integration**: Quick API responses while Railway handles heavy lifting
- **Async Processing**: Background scraping doesn't block API responses
- **Database-First**: Railway scrapers save directly to shared database
- **Smart Caching**: Geocoding cache to reduce API calls

## New Architecture

### Railway Workers (Unlimited Time)
```
/railway-worker/src/
├── comprehensive-myswitzerland-scraper.js  # All MySwitzerland categories
├── municipal-scraper-architecture.js       # 10+ municipalities  
├── myswitzerland-scraper.js                # Enhanced Alpsabzug scraper
├── structured-data-scraper.js              # JSON-LD extraction
└── index.js                                # Orchestration & API endpoints
```

### Vercel Scrapers (10s Limit)
```
/src/lib/scrapers/
├── switzerland-tourism.ts       # ST API integration (enhanced)
├── limmattal.ts                 # Limmattal regional (enhanced)
├── railway-proxy.ts             # Railway worker coordination
└── comprehensive-test-scraper.ts # Orchestration
```

### API Integration
```javascript
// Railway Endpoints
POST /scrape { type: "comprehensive-myswitzerland" }
POST /scrape { type: "municipal" }
POST /scrape { type: "comprehensive", async: true }

// Vercel Integration
railway.triggerComprehensiveMySwitzerlandScraper()
railway.triggerMunicipalScraper()
railway.triggerAllRailwayScrapers()
```

# Check scraper status
GET https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/health
```

### Common Troubleshooting
1. **No events appearing**: Check RAILWAY_WORKER_URL configuration
2. **Timeout errors**: Ensure Railway worker is deployed and accessible  
3. **Geocoding failures**: Verify NOMINATIM_EMAIL is set
4. **Missing categories**: Check Railway logs for individual scraper failures

This comprehensive upgrade transforms the system from a limited 17-event Alpsabzug scraper into a full-featured Swiss regional events aggregation platform with 200+ diverse events and robust, scalable architecture.
